## Summary

If you are doing data analysis you are probably using language models (e.g. ChatGPT) to help you write code, but are you using them in the most effective way? Language models have different biases to humans and so make different types of errors. This book will cover how to use language models to learn scientific computing and conduct reliable environmental analyses. The book is reference material for a 1-day workshop I teach. 

I will cover:

- How to use different software tools from the simple interfaces like ChatGPT to advanced tools that can run and test code by themselves and keep going until the analysis is complete (and even written up).

- Vibe coding and how future analysis workflows will change dramatically from today
- Best practice prompting techniques that can dramatically improve model performance for complex data analysis
- Applying language models to common environmental applications such as GLMs and multivariate statistics
-  Issues including environmental impacts, copyright and ethics
-  I’ll also make space for an interactive discussion of people’s concerns about AI, but also the opportunities. 

The content I’ll teach is suitable for anyone using computing coding (e.g. R, Python) to do data analysis.  

Examples will be in marine conservation science using the R language, but the methods are general to any field. The AI software is also general to any programming language and we won’t be doing much actual coding (the AI does that!) so readers can follow along in other languages if they prefer. 
To follow the practical applications you will need to have some experience in scientific computing (e.g. R or Python). 

## Citation for book

Please consider citing my accompanying article if you are using the advice in this book, currently in pre-print form:

**Citation: Brown & Spillias (2025). Prompting large language models for quality ecological statistics. Pre-print. https://doi.org/10.32942/X2CS80**

Generative AI software for coding is changing fast. So this book will keep changing as I update it to reflect new developments. It does not make sense to publish it as a fixed book. The general guidelines for prompting, which have a longer shelf-life are captured in the article. So please cite that to support my work. 

## Who should read this book?  

The book is for: anyone who currently uses R, from intermittent users to 
experienced professionals. The workshop is not suitable for those that need an introduction to R and I'll assume students know at least what R does and are able to do tasks like read in data and create plots.

Important This book isn’t for people who need an introduction to R or Python. I’ll assume students know at least how to do tasks like read in data and create plots in Python or R. To use these AI tools effectively you absolutely have to understand how scientific computing works first. If you need an introduction to R then I recommend you learn it without AI first. 

## Is the book up to date? 

The large language model industry is changing rapidly. I'll periodically update this book to keep up with developments. I also recommend checking out [Large Language Model tools for R](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/before-start.html) by Luis D. Verde Arregoitia. This is a living list of tools and R packages for using LLMs. 

## About Chris 

I'm an Associate Professor of Fisheries Science at University of Tasmania and an Australian Research Council Future Fellow. I specialise in data analysis and modelling, skills I use to better inform environmental decision makers. R takes me many places and I've worked with marine ecosystems from tuna fisheries to mangrove forests. I'm an experienced teacher of R. I have taught R to 100s people over the years, from the basics to sophisticated modelling and for everyone from undergraduates to my own supervisors.

## Software you'll need for this workshop

Save some time for setting up the software, there is a bit to it. You may also need IT help if your computer is locked down. See the [Chapter 3](03-set-up.qmd) on for more detailed instructions. 

## Book overview 

Note the book is still under construction. Most sections are complete, but a few sections just have bullet points that I refer to when teaching the workshop. It's also a fast moving space, so the content needs constant updating.

## Data 

We'll load all data files directly via URL in the workshop notes. So no need to download any data now. Details on data attribution are below. 

### Benthic cover surveys and fish habitat
 
In this course we'll be analyzing benthic cover and fish survey data. These data were collected by divers doing standardized surveys on the reefs of Kia, Solomon Islands. These data were first publshed by [Hamilton et al. 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.024) who showed that logging of forests is causing sedimentation and impact habitats of an important fishery species.

 In a follow-up study [Brown and Hamilton 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13079) developed a Bayesian model that estimates the size of the footprint of pollution from logging on reefs.
