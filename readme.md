# AI Assistants for Scientific Coding

TODO

Need to test prompts in chpt 8

Add code that shows how to attach a file to an ellmer request... 

Think of better examples for chapt 8 - break problem down... 

Add an example where I collect data from the class on model performance.

'Paper in a prompt' need to work on references, get it to put them as bibtex in references.bib, will need to explain how. 
Use orchestrate mode. 
Add a 'ding'. 


Change all examples to the benthic analysis one
Make my own prompt pattern repo
Incldue pattern for creating r tutorials from docs
Think in probablities about code, not exacts

Add function for chat bot for python users

```
## Improving your prompts

TODO Insert some examples comparing with and without these approaches

### Being specific

### Giving context

Showing data etc... 

### Giving examples 
```

Then come back to a sections on my workflows and optimal prompt stuctures

add something about multi-turn conversation being sub-optimal. 

Upload revised presentation. Revise with section on prompting. 

Make a quiz to do at end to get student feedback

Work on fundamentals, add some examples where user can experiment with differnet prompt styles.

## Lethal trifecta for 

The [Lethal Trifecta for prompt injection attacks](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/) (coined by Simon Williamson) is access to private data, ability to communicate externally and exposure to untrusted content. 

What can happen is that if your agent can read untrusted sources, those sources may contain malicious prompts. These prompts could convince the agent to do things like send or post your personal data to the hacker or create malicious code that runs on your computer. 

You want to be sure your agents can't do these three things at once. Remember sensitive data includes your name, username, phone number, email, API keys as well as sensitive research data. 

### Avoiding the lethal trifecta 

## Teaching plan


Set-up and run an agent 'paper in a prompt. 
Initial seminar

Overview of VSCode and copilot with class (just introduction to its different features )

Chatbots in ellmer 

Then look at stats workflows (chapter 8)
- asking problem solving. Include diy stats bot again. Compare multi-turn etc...
- Implementation advice
- Actual coding 
- Run some experiments with class, get half to do one thing, half to do something different. e.g. get them to try specific vs vague prompt and score the answers. 

Spec sheets 

Now come back to complete chapter 4 and look at temperature etc.... 

Chapter 5 on advanced applications if time.
