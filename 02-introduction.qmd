**Time:** 9-10am

In this presentation I'll cover how LLMs work, best practices prompt engineering, software, applications for R users and ethics.

This chapter provides an overview of:

- How Large Language Models (LLMs) function and their capabilities
- Best practices for prompt engineering when working with R
- Software options available for R users to interact with LLMs (coding assistants)
- Practical applications of LLMs for R programming and data analysis
- Ethical considerations when using LLMs for scientific work


We'll explore how LLMs can enhance your R workflow, from code generation to data analysis assistance, while maintaining scientific rigor and reproducibility.
