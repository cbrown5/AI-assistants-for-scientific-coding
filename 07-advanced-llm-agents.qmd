# Advanced LLM agents

**Software requirements:** VScode with R, Roo code, API license.

We'll take a quick look at [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/) and its customization options. 

Roo code is more complex and expensive to use than copilot, but allows significant amounts of customization to make bespoke agents that can help with the scientific process. 

I'll use an example with the Benthic Data analysis (benthic-readme.md). 

Talk through:

- API access
- Model options
- Customizing system message
- Context window management
- Cost
- Vision capabilities


You can also just accept every suggestion without reading it, also called 'vibe coding'. However, I don't recommend doing that, especially when you are starting out. You need to get a feel of how much direction it needs and problems it might create. Without human intervention the algorithms have a tendency to go off task: 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)

# Create data for the workflows, now flowing vertically
workflow1 <- data.frame(
    x = rep(1, 100),
    y = seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
)

# Add checkin points
checkins <- data.frame(
    x = rep(1, 5),
    y = seq(1, 9, by = 2)
)

# Create divergent workflow
workflow2 <- data.frame(
    x = 1 + 0.2 * (seq(0, 10, length.out = 100) - 3)^2 / 10,
    y = seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
)
workflow2$x[1:31] <- 1

# Create the plot
p <- ggplot() +
    # Draw workflows
    geom_path(data = workflow1, aes(x = x, y = y), 
                        color = "blue", linewidth = 1, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) +
    geom_path(data = workflow2, aes(x = x, y = y), 
                        color = "red", linewidth = 1,  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) +
    # Add checkin points
    geom_point(data = checkins, aes(x = x, y = y), 
                         color = "blue", size = 3) +
    # Add start and end points (now at top and bottom)
    annotate("text", x = 1, y = -0.3, label = "A (Start)", size = 8) +
    annotate("text", x = 1, y = 11, label = "B (Goal)", size = 8) +
    
    # Add labels
    annotate("text", x = 0.7, y = 5, label = "Workflow with checkins", color = "blue", size = 7, angle = 90) +
    annotate("text", x = 2.5, y = 7, label = "Divergent workflow\n(no checkins)", color = "red", size = 7) +
    
    # Theme adjustments
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank()
    ) +
    ylim(-0.5, 11) +
    xlim(0.5, 3.5)

Have a readme with clear steps that you attach as a prompt is also helpful for Agent mode. It helps it stay on topic. 

Agent mode also allows installation of additional tools, which we'll explore later.
